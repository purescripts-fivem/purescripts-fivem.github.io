# esx-clothing

## Pre Requisites

If your outfits are stored within the database datastore_data and have the name of dressing etc, this will work, if you are unsure if it will work please look in the code @ `pure-clothing/server/framework/esx/sv_migration` and it is the function called `loadOutfits`

Any questions open a ticket!

## Client

Get your players when they have loaded in to run a command loadmyoutfits - this has a fail safe meaninig they can only run it once!
