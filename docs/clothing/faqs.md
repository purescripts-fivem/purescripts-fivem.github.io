# Faqs

## My sidebar isn't changing colour when I change the theme?

Make you sure are changing the correct file in the build file, check here for more information: [Themes](/clothing/themes)

## I don't see my character with my mutlicharacter system?

If you are using migration check the database to ensure that everything has migrated properly

If you are not using migration this is normal if you have not loaded onto your character as it will not have the clothing to display - do not worry as you click on your character when you spawn a menu will popup with the create character menu

If you have made a character and it still does not show up, make sure you are setting it up correctly within your multicharacter system - any issues open a ticket
