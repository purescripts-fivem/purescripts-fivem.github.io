# Themes

## Changing the scrollbar colour

This can be somewhat complicated if you need help join the discord for support!

Locate the file `pure-crafting/build/assets/index.....css` or search for :root and change the following:

```css
:root {
  --scrollbar-bg: #212121; -- this is the background colour of the scrollbar
  --scrollbar-main: #333333; -- this is the main colour of the scrollbar refer to 'main-colour'
}
```

## Changing the theme

Locate the file `pure-crafting/config/themes.json` and change the following:

**_DO NOT COPY AND PASTE THIS BELOW AS THIS HAS COMMENTS AND WILL THROW AND ERROR SIMPLY USE THIS AS A GUIDE_**

```json

```
